This employee tracker application uses command line prompts to create, read, and update data from a database using SQL. The application joins multiple tables so that the user can view multiple columns of information that are related through their primary and foreign keys. User can also add new employees, roles, or departments. Employees can be update. In the future, added functionality will allow the user to udpate any table and delete infromation from any table as well.
